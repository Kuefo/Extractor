# Dash-Resource-Extractor
Not the craziest thing I've ever made, just a tool I made while bored to make extracting the shared resources from xam easier.

- Requires xextool. You can find xextool.exe in the releases.

[Resource Extractor Download](https://github.com/Heaventh007/Dash-Resource-Extractor/releases)

## How to use

- Download the tool from the releases page.

- Drag the xam.xex for the dash you want onto the tool.

- Once the tool has finished, you will find the shrdres.xzp in the tool directory.

You can also provide a custom extract directory like this: \
DashResourceExtractor.exe "XamPath" "Extract Directory"
